# Japanese Resources
Below are some of the best Japanese language learning guides and resources I have found. Each one is immensely useful and filled with transferable resources.

* <a href=https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/ target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Moe Way </a> is an online website, similar to this one, but much better. Especially for JP.
* <a href=https://lazyguidejp.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/ target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Lazy Guide to Japanese </a> is like Moes Way, but focused more on automation Setup. (Transfers to Korean easily.)
* <a href=https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/setupeverythingelse/ target="_blank" rel="noopener"> JP Mining Note Resouces. </a> Contains all the rest of the resouces and links you could need. I hope.
* <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/index/startersguide/ target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Reddit Japanese Megathread </a> is a large collection of more resources
