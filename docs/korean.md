## Hangul: The Korean Alphabet

The first crucial step to learning Korean is mastering Hangul, the Korean alphabet. There are 24 basic characters to learn. Do not be concerned with the specific method of learning them – whether through writing or other resources.

Below are a few recommended resources to assist in learning Hangul:

## Anki: Spaced Repetition System

### Installation

[Anki](https://docs.ankiweb.net/platform/windows/installing.html){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is an indispensable tool for language learning. It is a Spaced Repetition System (SRS)-based flashcard program that optimizes review schedules to maximize retention. Anki is free on Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and Android devices. Please note that it costs $24.99 on Apple iOS devices.

### Setup

Setting up Anki is straightforward. A detailed setup guide is coming soon, but for now, general Anki setup guides for other languages or the default settings can be used.

Once Anki is installed, the true grind begins. Many excellent [pre-made Korean flashcard decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=korean){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} are available to kickstart vocabulary and grammar acquisition.

Some recommended decks include:

* [Korean Grammar Sentences by Evita](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3614346923){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [Korean Vocabulary by Evita](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/4066961604){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [TTMIK's First 500 Korean Words](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1551455917){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [Korean Vocabulary Core 2k/5k/10k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/994297597){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (Features multilingual support)

Aim to learn approximately 20 new words daily and diligently complete reviews. Consistency is paramount for making significant progress. As new words are learned, ensure engagement with Korean content through various resources such as textbooks, grammar guides, graded readers, and pronunciation guides. Content choices should align with specific learning goals (e.g., reading, conversation, or speech).

## The Grind: Immersion & Mining

This is often the most challenging, yet ultimately rewarding and time-consuming, part of language learning: immersion. Once a foundational vocabulary (recommended 500 words or more) is established, active engagement with Korean content and self-challenge can begin. Fortunately, several tools and workflows can make this process **much** easier and more bearable.

### Yomitan: Popup Dictionary & Anki Integration

Yomitan is an incredibly useful browser extension that functions as a popup dictionary. Hovering over Korean text on a webpage will automatically display definitions and audio. Its main feature is Anki integration, allowing effortless "mining" of new cards. "Mining" refers to the process of encountering a new word, looking it up, and adding it to an Anki deck for later study.

#### Examples

=== "Yomitan Lookup"

#### Setup
First, install dictionaries for use in Yomitan. Downloading all dictionaries or the same ones is not required.

* Install [krdict_v2.zip](https://github.com/Samuihasu/krdict-yomichan/releases/tag/v2){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* Install [Frequency & IPA & KO-EN](https://github.com/Lyroxide/yomitan-ko-dic/releases){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (Press 'Show all 30 assets')
* Install [Hanja Dict](https://github.com/peldas/yomitan-dicts?tab=readme-ov-file#korean-korean){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

##### Step by Step

=== "Step One"
    Press "Configure installed and enabled dictionaries."
    ### Importing Step 1
    <img src="/assets/yomitan-3.png" alt="Yomitan Import Step One" class="image">
=== "Step Two"
    Press import and select all dictionaries to be imported. Then re-order as desired, referencing the example below.
    ### Importing Step 2

With dictionaries installed, open Yomitan settings and import settings using [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12FBuZJ5jdv5z7pou3WZPY5cfOTZmUcfU/view?usp=sharing){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Yomitan lookups should now function. Hold shift for bilingual lookups, and alt-shift for monolingual. To set up Anki, refer to other guides, such as [Moes Way](https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### TTSU Reader: Online Epub Reader

[TTSU Reader](https://reader.ttsu.app){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is an online EPUB reader that works seamlessly with Yomitan, as demonstrated in the examples above. Its primary benefit is enabling easy copy-pasting of text and Yomitan usage. EPUBs can be sourced in various ways, some of which will be listed in the Resources section [TODO].
