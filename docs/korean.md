# Welcome to Your Korean Language Journey!

Welcome to the beginning of your Korean language journey! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with learning Korean effectively.

## Hangul: The Korean Alphabet

The first crucial step to learning Korean is mastering Hangul, the Korean alphabet. There are 24 basic characters to learn. Don't worry about how you learn them – whether you write them down or use other resources!

Below are a few recommended resources to help you learn Hangul:

## Anki: Spaced Repetition System

### Installation

<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/platform/windows/installing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anki</a> is an indispensable tool for language learning. It's a Spaced Repetition System (SRS)-based flashcard program that optimizes your review schedule to maximize retention. Anki is free on Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and Android devices. Please note that it costs $24.99 on Apple iOS devices.

### Setup

Setting up Anki is straightforward. A detailed setup guide is coming soon, but for now, you can use general Anki setup guides for other languages or simply start with the default settings.

Once you have Anki installed, the true grind begins! You can choose from many excellent <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=korean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-made Korean flashcard decks</a> to kickstart your vocabulary and grammar acquisition.

Some recommended decks include:

* <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3614346923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korean Grammar Sentences by Evita</a>
* <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/4066961604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korean Vocabulary by Evita</a>
* <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1551455917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TTMIK's First 500 Korean Words</a>
* <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/994297597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korean Vocabulary Core 2k/5k/10k</a> (Features multilingual support)

Aim to learn about 20 new words every day and diligently complete your reviews. Consistency is paramount for making significant progress. As you learn new words, make sure to engage with Korean content through various resources like textbooks, grammar guides, graded readers, and pronunciation guides. Your content choices should align with your specific learning goals (e.g., reading, conversation, or speech).

## The Grind: Immersion & Mining

This is often the most challenging, yet ultimately rewarding and time-consuming, part of language learning: immersion. Once you have a foundational vocabulary (I recommend 500 words or more), you'll want to start engaging with Korean content more earnestly and challenging yourself. Fortunately, several tools and workflows can make this process **much** easier and more bearable.

### Yomitan: Popup Dictionary & Anki Integration

Yomitan is an incredibly useful browser extension that functions as a popup dictionary. You can simply hover over Korean text on a webpage, and definitions along with audio will automatically appear. Its main feature is Anki integration, allowing you to "mine" new cards effortlessly. "Mining" refers to the process of encountering a new word, looking it up, and adding it to your Anki deck for later study.

#### Examples

=== "Yomitan Lookup"

    ### Looking up a Word with Yomitan
    Here is me using Yomitan while reading 꼬마 중위 in TTSU Reader (below)

#### Setup
First, let's install some dictionaries for use in Yomitan. You don't have to download all the dicts, or the same ones.

* Install <a href="https://github.com/Samuihasu/krdict-yomichan/releases/tag/v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">krdict_v2.zip</a>
* Install <a href="https://github.com/Lyroxide/yomitan-ko-dic/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frequency & IPA & KO-EN</a> (Press 'Show all 30 assets')
* Install <a href="https://github.com/peldas/yomitan-dicts?tab=readme-ov-file#korean-korean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hanja Dict</a>

##### Step by Step

=== "Step One"
    Press "Configure installed and enabled dictionaries."
    ### Importing Step 1
    <img src="/assets/yomitan-3.png" alt="Yomitan Import Step One" class="image">
=== "Step Two"
    Press import and select all dictionaries you want to import. Then re-order as wanted, reference below.
    ### Importing Step 2

Now that you have all the dicts installed, open Yomitan settings and import settings, using this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12FBuZJ5jdv5z7pou3WZPY5cfOTZmUcfU/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file</a>.

All your Yomitan look up should work! Hold shift for bilingual, and alt-shift monolingual! To setup anki, refer to one of the other guides for now such as <a href="https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moes Way</a>.

### TTSU Reader: Online Epub Reader

<a href="https://reader.ttsu.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TTSU Reader</a> is an online EPUB reader that works seamlessly with Yomitan, as seen in the examples above. Its primary benefit is enabling you to easily copy and paste text and use Yomitan. You can source your EPUBs in various ways, some of which will be listed in the Resources section [TODO].
