# Hangul

Welcome to the beginning of your Korean language journey!

The first step to learning Korean is to learn all the Hangul! That's right, all 24 of them. You can use any resource you want for this, even write them down, it doesn't matter. I have left a few resources below to help you out if you have trouble!

# Anki 
## Installation
[Anki](https://docs.ankiweb.net/platform/windows/installing.html) is the next step, if you don't know what Anki is and have never used it before, Anki is a SRS(Spaced Repitition System)-based flash card program. It is free on Desktop and Android, however it cost "$24.99" on Apple and IOS devices. 
## Setup
Once you have obtained Anki, the true grind begins. Choose any [premade Korean flash card deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=korean), and get started! Some decks I would recommend are:

* [Korean Grammar Sentences by Evita ](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3614346923)
* [Korean Vocabulary by Evita](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/4066961604)
* [TTMIK's First 500 Korean Words](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1551455917)
* [Korean Vocabulary Core 2k/5k/10k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/994297597) (Multilingual Support)

Once you have a premade deck installed, make sure to learn about 20~ new words everyday AND do your reviews. The most important thing is staying consistent, if you don't you will make little progress. While learning all those new words make sure to engage in Korean content of some kind, such as textbooks, grammar guides, graded readers, pronunciation guides, etc. Depending on your goal in learning Korean (reading, conversation, speech), you will want to engage in different content.


# The Grind (Immersion & Mining)
The most painful, fufilling, and time consuming part of language learning. Immersion. Now that you have some words under your belt, whether it be 300, 500, or 2000 (I recommend 500 or more). You will want to begin engaging with korean content more earnestly, and challenge yourself more. Luckily I have a list of tools and workflows to make this **much, much** easier and more bearable.

## Yomitan 
Yomitan is a popup dictionary, which means you can hover over text and have definitions automatically appear along with audio! It even supports anki integration, which means you can "Mine" cards very easily! "Mining" is when you see a new word, and add it to study later. In the example below I am using Yomitan on 응시하다, and then clicking the plus button to add it to anki.

## Examples

=== "Yomitan Lookup"

    ### Looking up a word
    Here's a screenshot showing the Yomitan dictionary overlay when looking up a word on a webpage.
