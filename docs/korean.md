# Welcome to Your Korean Language Journey!

## Intro
Welcome to the beginning of your Korean language journey! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with learning Korean effectively.


Let me first and foremost start with a small warning; this guide is HEAVILY WIP. This guide is also HEAVILY influenced by [:octicons-arrow-right-24:Japanese Resources](japanese.md). Almost all of the Japanese resources are transferable with some work! Additional Korean Resources can be found in the [:octicons-arrow-right-24:Korean Resources](koreanresources.md) page.

Now that we have the out of the way, here is some cruicial info for learning Korean! 

---

* Make sure to have a goal!

Having a concrete goal in mind will keep you motivated and most importantly CONSISTENT! It also lets you know how and what you should study. (e.g., reading, conversation, or speech).

* Don't use Duolingo.

Although fun, Duolingo and most other language learning apps are extremely inefficient, and made just to steal your time and money. They should be discarded after entering the beginning phases of learning.

* Stay Consistent!

It's really that simple, just stay consistent. This is the most important part of language learning. Everything else is easy.

## Hangul: The Korean Alphabet

Your first step into learning Korean is mastering Hangul, the Korean alphabet. There are 24 basic characters to learn. Do not be concerned with the specific method of learning them – whether through writing or other resources.

Below are a few recommended resources to assist in learning Hangul:

## Vocab with Anki
Now its time to learn some vocab, and there exist few ways better than Anki for learning Vocabulary quickly and easily.
### Installation

[Anki](https://docs.ankiweb.net/platform/windows/installing.html){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is an indispensable tool for language learning. It is a Spaced Repetition System (SRS)-based flashcard program that optimizes review schedules to maximize retention. Anki is free on Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and Android devices. Please note that it costs $24.99 on Apple iOS devices.

### Setup

Setting up Anki is straightforward. A detailed setup guide is coming soon, but for now, general Anki setup guides for other languages or the default settings can be used.

Once Anki is installed, the true grind begins. Many excellent [pre-made Korean flashcard decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=korean){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} are available to kickstart vocabulary and grammar acquisition.

Some recommended decks include:

* [Korean Grammar Sentences by Evita](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3614346923){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [Korean Vocabulary by Evita](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/4066961604){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [TTMIK's First 500 Korean Words](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1551455917){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [Korean Vocabulary Core 2k/5k/10k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/994297597){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
* Make your own with an epub with Novel to Anki (Very scrappy, results will not be perfect) [Here](koreanresources.md)

**Start** with just one or two decks and aim to learn approximately 20 (or 40 if you have a lot of time) new words daily and diligently complete reviews.  
**Consistency** is paramount for making significant progress. <br>
**As new words** are learned, ensure engagement with Korean content through various resources such as textbooks, grammar guides, graded readers, and pronunciation guides. <br>
**Content choices** should align with specific learning goals (e.g., reading, conversation, or speech).


Some tips if you struggle with remembering new words:

* Write down the new words, sound them out as you do so, and think of the actual meaning/action/object, not the english meaning.
* Practice making sentences with the new words!
* Watch/Read/Engage with media where the word appears frequently.

## The Grind: Immersion & Mining

This is often the most challenging, yet ultimately rewarding and time-consuming, part of language learning: immersion. Once a foundational vocabulary (recommended 500 words or more) is established, active engagement with Korean content and self-challenge can begin. Fortunately, several tools and workflows can make this process **much** easier and more bearable.

### Yomitan: Popup Dictionary & Anki Integration

Yomitan is an incredibly useful browser extension that functions as a popup dictionary. Hovering over Korean text on a webpage will automatically display definitions and audio. Its main feature is Anki integration, allowing effortless "mining" of new cards. "Mining" refers to the process of encountering a new word, looking it up, and adding it to an Anki deck for later study.

#### Examples

=== "Yomitan Lookup"

    ### Looking up a Word with Yomitan

#### Setup
First, install dictionaries for use in Yomitan. Downloading all dictionaries or the same ones is not required. 

IPA Dict provides pronounciation, Frequency gives relative frequency, ie: 1 = Most Common.

* Install [Frequency & IPA & KO-EN](https://github.com/Lyroxide/yomitan-ko-dic/releases){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (Press 'Show all 30 assets') // Main recommended dictionary; sourced from (Korean Learners Dictionary) 
* Install [Hanja Dict](https://github.com/peldas/yomitan-dicts?tab=readme-ov-file#korean-english){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} // From a different source than above, provides better hanja lookup when used in conjunction with above.
* Install [jarjumarvins dict](https://github.com/jarjumarvin/yomichan_krdict/releases/tag/v1.1.0){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} // Provides a Hanja.zip which breaks down hanja. As well as krdict sourced from (Korean Learners Dictionary)

For Additional Coverage 

* [kty-ko-en.zip](https://pub-c3d38cca4dc2403b88934c56748f5144.r2.dev/releases/latest/kty-ko-en.zip){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a wiktionary that can help with some obscure words
<br>
* [SpazzTL's Supplemental Dictionary](https://github.com/SpazzTL/Supplemental-Korean-Dictionary){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  is a  billingual dictionary I am making that will help with words missed by the other dictionaries, mainly words that appear in webnovels and manhwa. Currently no version out yet.

Installing overlapping dictionaries has no large downsides other than performance. \

##### Step by Step

With dictionaries installed, open Yomitan settings and import settings using [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12FBuZJ5jdv5z7pou3WZPY5cfOTZmUcfU/view?usp=sharing){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Yomitan lookups should now function. Hold shift for bilingual lookups, and alt-shift for monolingual. To set up Anki, refer to other guides, such as [Moes Way](https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or the [Official Guide](https://yomitan.wiki/anki/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
