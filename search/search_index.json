At first the reviews may seem super easy and take no time, but within 1-2 weeks you will have 100-200 reviews per day. \\ Consistency is paramount for making significant progress.  As new words are learned, ensure engagement with Korean content through various resources such as textbooks, grammar guides, graded readers, and pronunciation guides.  Content choices should align with specific learning goals (e.g., reading, conversation, or speech).</p> <p>Some tips if you struggle with remembering new words:</p> <ul> <li>Write down the new words, sound them out as you do so, and think of the actual meaning/action/object, not the english meaning.</li> <li>Practice making sentences with the new words!</li> <li>Watch/Read/Engage with media where the word appears frequently.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"korean/#important-note","title":"Important Note:","text":"<p>Anki is not a magic wand, you can get good vocab through anki, but it MUST be used in conjunction with immersion of some kind for optimal and useable results.
